This lab is to be completed *as a team* on the first visit of your industry mentor.

That may be Tuesday 1/28, Wednesday 1/29, Tuesday 2/4 or Wednesday 2/5 depending on your team.

# Step 1:

You should have created a team repo (e.g. TEAM-t-5pm-a) during lecture on 1/28 or 1/29.

In that team repo, create a new file called `industry-mentor.md`.

In that file put this at the top:

```
# Industry Mentor Interview, (date)
```

Dont literally write `(date)`, but instead, put the date. :-)

You can do this directly on the master branch, and even right in the GitHub web interface if you want.

I suggest that you rotate through the team which team member is responsible for each
of the following steps.

# Step 2: 

In this file, record the name of your industry mentor, and the names of all the members
of your team that are present in lab.

# Step 3: 

Ask your industry mentor these questions, and record the answers:
* What company are they with
* How long have they been there
* What is their role (dev, ux, qa, pm, other)

# Step 4: 

Ask your industry mentor some of the questions that your team came up with 
in the exercise we did to create the team repo.   Record their questions and
a brief summary of their answers.

Some suggested topics:
* How you interact with customers to determine product requirements
* Testing
* Use of Version Control
* How a team functions together
* What a "retro" is
* What "sprint planning" involves
* How code goes from development into production
* What happens when bugs are discovered in the code
