*Reading Assignment:* 

* Read [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/) and [HFJ Chapter 6](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_6/), and consult the online reading notes by clicking on the chapter links at [https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/{{site.qxx}}/hwk/{{page.num}}/](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/{{site.qxx}}/hwk/{{page.num}}/). Then, do the problems below.
* Note that you may also need to look back at [HFJ Chapter 4](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_4/) (or even at earlier chapters) for some problems.

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1">(10 pts) Write a few lines of code that demonstrate how to take a integer value that is in a `String`, and convert it to an integer value in an `int` variable. You can find an example of this in 
[HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/)

<li style="margin-bottom:10em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) (From [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/)) Assume that `n` is an `int` variable that has already been assigned some value greater than or equal to 1. Write a few lines of Java code that declare a new `int` variable `x` and assign it a random integer between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive, uniformly distributed over all n possible values.)

(10 pts) (From [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/)) Proponents of Test Driven Developent (TDD) suggest you write your tests *before* you write your code. Why?

<li style="margin-bottom:18em;" markdown="1"> 
(10 pts) From the online reading notes for [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/): TDD is a part of a larger movement called eXtreme Programming (XP) that led to an even larger movement called Agile, that includes many other programming practices. Identify two of those other than TDD. (By *identify*, I mean that to earn full credit, you need to *both* name, *and* briefly explain (1 sentence) each of these two other practices. There are far more than just two, but any two that are legitimately core to Agile are acceptable.)

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (10 pts) Frequently asked "job interview" question that comes from somewhere in [HFJ Chapter 4](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_4/) or [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/): briefly explain: part of Object-Oriented Programming is "encapsulation". What is "encapsulation"?

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> 

Review the difference between plain old java arrays (as in [HFJ Chapter 4](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_4/))
and the `ArrayList<T>` type (as in [HFJ Chapter 6](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_6/)).  
Assume that a class called `Student` exists.

<ol>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">(10 pts) Write a line of java that makes a  plain old Java array ([HFJ Chapter 4](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_4/) style) of `Student` references of size 5. (Don't allocate the `Student` objects, just the array of references, initially null).    
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1">(10 pts) Now, write a line of java that makes an `ArrayList<Student>` of `Student` references ([HFJ Chapter 6](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_6/) style).   Capacity is unimportant---choose 5, or take the default, whatever you like. (Don't allocate the `Student` objects, just the `ArrayList<Student>`, initially empty).

<li style="margin-bottom:8em;" markdown="1"> (20 pts) From [HFJ Chapter 5](http://ucsb-cs56.github.io/hfj/HFJ_Chapter_5/): Java 1.5 introduced a new (to Java) kind of for loop sometimes called a "foreach" loop (even though foreach is not a keyword in Java)&mdash;your textbook calls it the "enhanced for loop". HFJ provides an overview of this kind of loop on p. 105 and 116. Write a few lines of code that declare an array of five integers, initializing them to the first five prime numbers (you can use a literal array initializer here&mdash;you don't need to write code to compute the prime numbers), and then write a foreach type loop that iterates through that array printing out the values, one on each line.  (You are encouraged to check your answer by typing it into a main program online before submitting it).
