# Decisions Day (MW)

Please sit with your teams initially.

# 12:30 - 12:40 Epic Roll Call

I will ask one member from each team to summarize your team's project and epic in 60 seconds or less.

Double check your epic: one or two epics have changed since you did lab08>

* They are here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/projects/>

* One sentence on the project.
* Two sentences on the epic

# 12:40-13:00 Pros/Cons of the legacy code vs. individual track

There is no secret that I hope most students choose the legacy code track.

You will gain valuable skills, experience and insight from working on a legacy code project that are difficult to find in any undergraduate or even graduate course.  These skills are among the most sought out industry skills.  I beleive you'll be better prepared for job interviews for internships and permanent positions, and will be on-boarded more quickly when you start those jobs.

There are also rewards in working on code that will have a life beyond the course.  You are contributing to something real, something that will get used.

However I recognize that committing to a project team comes with challenges.   

You may have life or academic circumstances that make it difficult to make the necessary committment *for these next 3 weeks* to other team members to show up, carry your weight, communicate, etc.  This doesn't mean you aren't capable, just that *right now* isn't the right time for you.

So, there is no shame in choosing the individual project track, if that's the better choice.

## Grading

* Individual Track: Graded individually, like regular programming assignments.
* Legacy Code Track: Grading is rubric based, but inherently subjective, and all grades applied to the entire group.
  * Committing to the legacy code track is an act of faith and trust on both sides
  * You express trust in your team, and trust in the grading staff to treat you fairly.
  * We express trust that you will make a good faith effort to commit to your learning and to completing the tasks to the best of your ability.

## Attendance

Project Track:
* You'll need to make a committment to attending lecture and lab, since in each lecture and lab, you'll have standup meetings to coordinate with your team.   
* You'll get some time in every lecture and lab to work with your team.

Individual Track:
* You'll need to come to most lectures, but you may not need to stay for the entire time.
* Some material will still be presented that will be on the final, and the pertains to both tracks.
* For lab, you may come to either the open or closed lab sessions for help with your project.


# 11:30-11:40 Consider your choices

## Compare your epic with others

In lab, you explored your own team's epic and project.

While the default is to stay with your assigned team and epic,
if there is room, you may be permitted to switch to another team.

Take a moment, to look at the other Epics for your discussion section.

* Link here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/projects/>

For example, if you are in the Tuesday 5pm section, on t-5pm-a, also
look at the epics for t-5pm-b, t-5pm-c and t-5pm-d.

There is also the remote possibility to switch to a different discussion
section if and only if:
* There is a team with fewer than 6 people (i.e. there is room)
* You can commit to participating in *that* section for the rest of the quarter.

## Consider the individual project track

The individual project track is not yet 100% ready, but it will be quite similar
to the F19 individual project track described here.  

* [proj01](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj01/) [proj02](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj02/) [proj03](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj03/) [proj04](https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/f19/lab/proj04/)

Differences:
* Google OAuth rather than GitHub OAuth
* Some of the steps were already done in the starter code
* We have some new challenges to add to the later steps

But it will be quite similar.


# 13:00-13:15 Discussion in your teams

You may now discuss in your teams which option you wish to choose.  Feel free to also visit other teams that have open slots if you want to explore.


# 13:15-13:25: Time to commit

Record your selection in this form

* <http://bit.ly/cs56-w20-team-selection>


## If you are on the individual track

Please go to the slack channel for your previous team (e.g. `#t-5pm-a`, `#t-5pm-b`, etc.)

* Make a post letting your mentor and your team know that you are leaving the team to do the individual track
* This isn't just a matter of poiiteness: they need to know so that your former team can adjust the team membership on GitHub.
* Once you've made that post, leave that Slack channel

Now, join the appropriate channel on slack for your discussion section
* For TR folks, one of `#t-5pm-individual`, `#t-6pm-individual`, `#t-7pm-individual`
* For MW folks, one of `#w-5pm-individual`, `#w-6pm-individual`, `#w-7pm-individual` 

You are then done for today, and you may leave.  You are welcome to stay and work quietly in the back of the room, but you are also free to go.

## If you are a NEW team (different from your original team)

Sit with your new team.

Please go to the slack channel for your previous team (e.g. `#t-5pm-a`, `#t-5pm-b`, etc.)

* Make a post letting your mentor and your team know that you are leaving the team to do the individual track
* This isn't just a matter of poiiteness: they need to know so that your former team can adjust the team membership on GitHub.
* Once you've made that post, leave that Slack channel

Next join the appropriate channel on slack for your new team

* Ask to be added to the team's GitHub Team
   * That is done here: <https://github.com/orgs/ucsb-cs56-w20/teams>
* Introduce yourself to your new mentor and your new team members.
   * Name, major, year
   * Something about what you chose this team

# 13:25-13:45: New Team Committments


You are now in a new team.  

Even if it has the exact same members as the old team, it is new because it has a new purpose.

There a few housekeeping issues.  Divide these up among the team.  On the slack, record which team members is taking responsibilty for each of these.  If you have only 4 team members, someone will need to take on two tasks.  If you have 6, then two of you can pair on task 4 or task 5.

* Task 1: Go to your team's slack channel, and make a post recording the names of the updated members of the team
* Task 2: Visit <https://github.com/orgs/ucsb-cs56-w20/teams>.  For those members that have left the team, or joined the team, adjust the team membership.  Also, verify that all team members are "maintainers", not just members (so they can also add/delete team members.)
* Task 3: Find out when your team members "open lab hours" are. You can find that out here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/w20/info/office_hours/>
   * Write down those hours in a post in the slack channel, e.g. if your mentor is Max Colbert, write in the slack channel:
     ```
     Our mentor is Max Colbert and his open lab hours are 5-7 Mondays in Phelps 2510, and 7-8 Monday in Phelps 3526
     ```
   * Then ask your fellow team members to indicate, for each of those slots, whether they can attend it or not.
       * You can make a separate slot for each post, e.g. "Monday 5-5:30 Phelps 2510"
       * Invite team members to post a `:+1:` emoji (👍) if they can make it, and a `:thumbsdown:` emoji (👎) if they can't
* Task 4: Look at the Kanban board and see whether there are multiple issues that can be done in parallel, or whether the initial issues have to be done sequentially.   Post your findings to the Slack channel.   
  * If there are multiple issues that can be done in parallel, lead a discussion as to which team members will take on which issues initially, either individually or in pairs.
  * Invite students to assign themselves to issues, and drag those into the "In Progress" column
* Task 5: Initiate a discussion about team agreements.  You can learn more about those here: <https://ucsb-cs56.github.io/topics/teamwork/>
